            <h2 class="text-center">The Estates System: A Catalyst for Revolution</h2>

            <p>The Estates System, an archaic social stratification, has perpetuated inequality within French society,
                cleaving it into three disparate classes: the clergy and nobility of the First and Second Estates and
                the Third Estate encompassing the rest are artisans, farmers, and laborers. This inequitable division of
                privileges has ignited the revolutionary fervor among the Third Estate, burdened by excessive taxation
                and lacking political representation. It is imperative to abolish this outdated system and establish a
                society founded on egalitarian principles.</p>

                <p>As a Parisian baker, I am intimately acquainted with the hardships faced by our community. The bread
                    shortage has ravaged our livelihoods and stoked the fires of unrest. The exorbitant prices and
                    scarcity
                    of bread, a fundamental element of our sustenance, have pushed the populace to the edge. In these
                    desperate times, the call for revolution grows louder, driven not by malice but by an urgent need
                    for
                    survival and reform.</p>

                            King Louis XVI, born Louis-Auguste, ascended to the throne in 1774, inheriting a kingdom
                            burdened with debt and on the brink of revolution. Despite his well-rounded education and
                            interest in enlightenment ideas, Louis XVI found himself ill-prepared for the monumental
                            task of reforming the French state and society. His reign, marked by indecisiveness and
                            perceived ineptitude, culminated in the French Revolution—a period of radical social and
                            political upheaval.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            The political cartoon "Le peuple sous l'ancien Regime" vividly illustrates the burdensome
                            relationship between the monarchy and the common people, depicting Louis XVI, alongside a
                            bishop and a member of the aristocracy, riding on the back of a man representing the
                            oppressed populace[1]. This imagery captures the essence of the grievances that fueled the
                            revolutionary fervor of 1789.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Louis XVI's attempts at reform, including the summoning of the Estates-General in 1789, were
                            too little too late. The escalating crisis led to his arrest and eventual execution by
                            guillotine in 1793, marking the end of monarchical rule in France and the rise of the French
                            Republic[2]. His death not only symbolized the fall of the Ancien Régime but also served as
                            a cautionary tale of the perils of disconnect between a ruler and his subjects.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            The legacy of Louis XVI is complex, embodying the contradictions of a man who was at once a
                            king, a husband, a father, and a prisoner of his circumstances. His fascination with
                            locksmithing and the sciences, alongside his sponsorship of exploratory missions, such as
                            the first manned hot air balloon flight, highlight a monarch with interests far beyond the
                            confines of his royal duties[2][5].

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Today, Louis XVI remains a figure of intrigue and debate among historians, symbolizing the
                            end of an era and the painful birth of modern France.
